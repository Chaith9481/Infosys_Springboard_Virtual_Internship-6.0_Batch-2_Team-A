# ElectViz: Election Data Visualization for Media

## 🗳️ Project Overview
This project was completed as part of our internship with **Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0**.  
**ElectViz** is an interactive data visualization project designed to analyze, interpret, and present election data in a clear and engaging way. Developed using **Power BI**, this project transforms large-scale election datasets into intuitive dashboards that help media organizations, analysts, and the public gain meaningful insights into voting patterns, party performance, and regional election dynamics.

The project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can enhance political reporting by offering **fact-based, data-driven stories**. By simplifying complex datasets into visual narratives, *ElectViz* empowers users to make informed interpretations of election outcomes.
